# DDS-RasPi4-ESP32-Communication
Our teams goal was to design the smart braking system of a car, based on the provided
requirements of the clients. Communication of system components is achieved through
DDS. This system is able to detect the objects in front of the car and measure the current
speed at which the vehicle is moving. Based on this information we are able to calculate
the rate of braking required to safely slow down and avoid collisions. With this module
intact in the car, possible accidents could be avoided and passenger lives could be saved.
During this whole semester, I was working in a team. We all had the same tasks in the
beginning but in the later half of the project, we switched to our individual assignments,
which we could choose for ourselves. Our first weeks consisted of determining high level
requirements, figuring out possible executions for safety scenarios, building up high level
functional components and dividing up the project between ourselves. More on that later
on
